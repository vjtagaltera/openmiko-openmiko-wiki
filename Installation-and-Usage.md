## Installation and Usage

Before installing OpenMiko, we suggest you carefully read the [FAQ](/doc/faq.md).

Download the specific version of the firmware you wish to install. The releases can be found on the right hand side in Github under the label "Releases".

Rename the firmware to `demo.bin` and put it in on the root of the microSD card.

Power off the camera and insert the microSD card.

Hold the setup button, plug in your USB cable, keep holding the setup button for 1-2 seconds until the light is solid blue, then release the button.

After about 30 seconds you should get a flashing yellow LED which indicates the camera is working.
